# alicebot

C++ code example of telegram bot api. Use it `as is`. E-mail address for questions is ivorob[at]gmail.com.

The `example` directory contains a few examples of using telegram bot api. To compile library or examples use the following commands:
`cmake . && make`

To compile on Windows platform you can use the following commands below, but now I'm not sure that code will be compiled correctly. I didn't try to compile this api on Windows. This feature is in TODO-list.
`cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"`
`nmake`
